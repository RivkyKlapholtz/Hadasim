This system includes a partial server side, and a database for a corona database management system for a large health fund.
The system will present the members in the health insurance fund, and will manage the entry of the records in a database. In addition, the system will store key information regarding the corona epidemic in the context of the members of the health fund. In the future, they will be able to turn to this database in order to carry out various retrievals.

## Assumptions

* The cell phone field in the HMO member is optional, and can be NULL
* The rest of the fields in the HMO member are mandatory and cannot be NULL
* An example of the format for sending such an API request: 
```http
  POST /member
```
```http
 {
        "id": "666666666",
        "corona": {
            "sickDate": "2023-04-15",
            "recoveryDate": "2023-04-25"
        },
        "vaccines": [
            {
                "date": "2023-05-01",
                "manufacturer": "Novavax"
            },
            {
                "date": "2023-03-01",
                "manufacturer": "AstraZeneca"
            },
            {
                "date": "2023-02-01",
                "manufacturer": "AstraZeneca"
            }
        ],
        "image": null,
        "firstName": "Emily",
        "lastName": "Wang",
        "city": "Houston",
        "street": "Main Street",
        "housNumber": 789,
        "dayOfBirth": "1998-09-20",
        "phone": "5869234",
        "cellPhone": null
    }
```


## Bonus questions

1. Adding the ability to upload a photo of the checkout member on the client side and display it?

```http
   //in Member Class
   @Lob
   private byte[] image;

   public byte[] getImage() {
        return image;
    }

    public void setImage(byte[] image) {
        this.image = image;
    }

    //in MemberController Class
    @PostMapping("/uploading-image/{id}")
    public String checkout(@PathVariable("id") String id, @RequestParam("image") MultipartFile image) throws IOException {
        Member member = memberService.getMemberById(id);
        member.setImage(image.getBytes());
        memberService.saveOrUpdate(member);
        return "upload_success";
    }

    @GetMapping("/members/{id}/image")
    @ResponseBody
    public ResponseEntity<byte[]> getImage(@PathVariable String id) {
        Member member = memberService.getMemberById(id);
        if (member.getImage() != null) {
            HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
            headers.setContentType(MediaType.IMAGE_JPEG);
            headers.setContentLength(member.getImage().length);
            return new ResponseEntity<>(member.getImage(), headers, HttpStatus.OK);
        } else {
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
    }
```

2. Building an architectural specification of the system: the way of contacting the services
with the various APIs and a schematic view of the information in the database.
```http
  See separate file.
```


3. To present a summary view on the subject of the Corona virus:

* How many active patients were there each day in the last month (recommended to present as a graph)?
```http
  @GetMapping("/active-patients-last-month")
    private String getActivePatientsLastMonth() {
        List<Integer> activePatients = new ArrayList<>();
        LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
        for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
            LocalDate date = today.minusDays(i);
            int count = coronaService.getActivePatientsCountByDate(Date.valueOf(date));
            activePatients.add(count);
        }
        return drawGraph(activePatients);
    }

    public static String drawGraph(List<Integer> data) {
        int max = Collections.max(data);
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = max; i > 0; i--) {
            StringBuilder line = new StringBuilder();
            for (int j = 0; j < data.size(); j++) {
                if (data.get(j) >= i) {
                    line.append("â–ˆ ");
                } else {
                    line.append("  ");
                }
            }
            sb.append(line.toString() + "\n");
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < data.size(); i++) {
            sb.append("--");
        }
        sb.append("\n");

        for (int i = 1; i <= data.size(); i++) {
            sb.append(i + " ");
        }
        sb.append("\n");

        return sb.toString();
    }


```

* How many Copa members are not vaccinated at all?
```http
  @GetMapping("/members-notVaccinated")
    private int getNotVaccinatedMembers() {
        List<Member> allMembers = memberService.getAllMember();
        int count = 0;
        for (Member m : allMembers) {
            boolean vaccinated = false;
            for (Vaccine v : m.getVaccines()) {
                if (v.getDate() != null) {
                    vaccinated = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!vaccinated) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
